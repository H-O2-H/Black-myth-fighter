## Project Goals
This project aims to develop a neural network for the combat in "Black Myth" using PyTorch, enabling map navigation through screen recognition.

### Hard Requirements
1. The neural network must respond within 0.1 seconds.
2. It should perform basic map navigation operations in a linear map.
3. The AI can only use basic keyboard inputs; no combo moves are allowed.
4. The AI must be able to defeat Guangzhi, the first boss.

## Expected Problem Solving

1. Establish a basic interaction environment, including screen reading and program output to keyboard inputs.
2. Utilize a pre-trained network to enable map navigation capabilities.
3. Perform image segmentation and character state recognition.
4. Conduct basic combat training.
